 Development of ARCA aplication
 
Resume: 
 
I've made a windows APP using Python. The software was made to assist the treatment of my financial operations. In this software, I use many libraries, such as Selenium, SQLite3, PyQt5, MatplotLib, OS, yahoofinance, threading, xlsxwriter, pandas, tkinter, BeautifulSoup, json, requests, csv and so on. There are many things to do yet, but the APP base is already operational. Some of these things to improve are data treatment, data analysis and data presentation. 

Full description:

This aplication is meant to be an assistant to your financial life.
With this aplication you will be able to register all your transactions in a
offline way, check for tributations you owe (separed automatically by
Swing Trades and Day Trades) and get to know to which financial sector you are
more exposed.
Also, you can view in a simple way your returnings through time percentionally
and nominally.
To auxiliate in your decisions, we have implemented an algorithm to help you
catch some important market indicators and get some robot's recommendations.

Worried about your security, the app allows you to save your database file
in any folder you want. You can for exemple save it in a vault like
OneDrive's Vault or in a removable disk like DVD, Pendrive, external HD/SSD etc.
Also, you can generate a backup file and save wherever you want.

To don't loose your access to your database in case you forget your password,
we ask to inform your email, so if needed we can unlock your access by reaching
your confirmed email.

Have good trades ;)
